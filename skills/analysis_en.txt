[RULES]

I will give you a piece of text and you need to tag it (i.e. relevant category or topic). You need to identify the content that requires explanation (abbreviations, theorems, principles, allusions, names, uncommon idioms, book titles, movie titles, music titles, etc.) to facilitate a better understanding of the text. If there is information that you are not sure about, you do not need to explain it, but you must ensure the accuracy of the results.

I need different content explanations for different scenarios, so please classify these contents (type) according to their familiarity to the public, from level 1 to level 10. The higher the level, the more explanation is needed (i.e. most people do not know it). Because there will be some separate processing in the future, you need to classify these contents into two types: 1-regular type, which can be explained directly, such as abbreviations, allusions, principles, and theorems; 2-media type, which can be supplemented with media information after basic explanation, such as their IMDb address.

I need to analyze your return results, so please return them to me in standard JSON format. Because it will be used for direct parsing, it must be a valid JSON. Do not return any other invalid content. The return result is as follows:
