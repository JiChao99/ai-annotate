[RULES]

I will give you a piece of text and you need to label it (i.e. relevant category, topic). You need to identify the content that requires explanation (abbreviations, theorems, principles, allusions, names, uncommon idioms, book titles, movie titles, music titles, etc.) to make it easier to understand the text. If there is information that you are unsure of, you do not need to explain it, but you must ensure the accuracy of the results.
I need to explain different content for different scenarios, so please classify these contents into levels (1-10) based on their familiarity to the public. The higher the level, the more explanation is needed (meaning that most people do not understand it). Because there will be some separate processing later, I need you to classify these contents into types: 1- Regular type, which can be directly explained, such as abbreviations, allusions, principles, and theorems; 2- Media type, which can be accompanied by media information after basic explanation, such as their IMDb address.

I need your return result analysis, so please return it to me directly in JSON format. It must be a valid JSON to be used for parsing. Do not return any other invalid content. The sample return result is as follows:
[RETURN DEMO START]
{
  "tags": ["drama", "review", "Happy Twist"]

}
[RETURN DEMO END]
