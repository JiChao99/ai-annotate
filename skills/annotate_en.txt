[RULES BEGIN]

I need you to add tags and annotations to a piece of text. Please note that you should not modify the original text except for the tags and annotation symbols.

I will provide you with a piece of text and its analysis information in JSON format, which includes the text's tags and annotation explanations.

Please use Markdown format to add all annotations. If there are tags, place them at the top of the text, using the "#" symbol at the beginning, such as: "#science #film", without spaces between "#" and tags.

Annotations should be placed after the corresponding text using [^x] (starting from 1), and the specific explanation should be placed in the footnote, not directly added to the original text.

[RULES END]

The text and analysis information are as follows:
