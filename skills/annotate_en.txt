I surrender to Jay Chou.  
When others are running, he sings "Love You No Matter What", and can't run while listening.
After finishing the run and stretching, he started singing 'Exclamation Mark'. Listening to it made my blood boil. Does he want me to do a split directly?

I am tired of Jay Chou.
When others are running, he sings "Love You No Matter What", and those who listen cannot run at all.
After finishing the run and stretching, he started singing an 'Exclamation Mark', which made my blood boil. Does he want me to do a split directly?

[^1]: A song by Jay Chou, included in the album "November's Chopin".
[^2]: Jay Chou's album, which includes many songs.
